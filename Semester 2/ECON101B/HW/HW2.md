An increase in interest rate $r$ will lead to a decrease in optimal capital stock and hence a decrease in investment.

An decrease in the depreciation rate will lead to a increase in optimal capital stock and hence a increase in investment.

An increase in animal spirits (red curve) will shift the expected $MP_{K}$, and while holding $r+\delta$ constant, the optimal capital stock and investment will increase.

Consider a firm facing the choice of investing a unit of capital or saving it and earning interest. In equilibrium, the firm must be indifferent to the two options:
1. Invest one unit and earn $(1-\tau )MP_{K}$, and sell the un-depreciated part and earn $1-\delta$.
2. Saving the unit and earn the interest $1+r$.
Setting these two equal to each, we get the new user cost of capital equation,
$$MP_{K}=\frac{r + \delta }{1-\tau }.$$

An increase in tax will lead to a decrease in optimal capital stock and hence a decrease in investment.

If the output grows more than the capital stock in a given time period, firms must invest to compensate.
