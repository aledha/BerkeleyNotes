Main idea: look at the determinants of economic growth and the standard of living in the long run.

Previously, we assumed that **capital** $K$ and **labor supply** $N$ were fixed, idea being that the economy would return to these in the long run.
	Now, $K$ is positively affected by investment, negatively by depreciation.
	$N$ is positively affected by population growth.
Some features:
* Consumption function is simpler
* No $G$ or $T$
* Lowercase $k$ means capital stock per capita.

### Production function
$$Y=F(K,N)$$
define $y=Y/N,k=K/N$ per capita. 
Constant return to scale:
$$zY=F(zK,zN)\quad\forall\quad z>0.$$
then,
$$\begin{align*}
Y/N&= F(K/N,N/N)\\
y&= F(k,1)\\
y&= f(k)
\end{align*}$$
