The slopes were estimated using the Polynomials package, disregarding the last point for $p=8$ and the last two points when $p=16$, since they seem to be affected by rounding errors. Since we are looking for asymptomatic behavior, I also disregard the first point.

Again, I threw away the last point for $p=8$ and the last two points while estimating the slope for $p=16$.
