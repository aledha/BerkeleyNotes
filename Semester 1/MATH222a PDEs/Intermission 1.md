There are four model PDEs which we wish to study.

1. Laplace $- \Delta u=0$
2. Wave $-\partial_{t}^{2}y+\Delta u=0$
3. Heat $\partial_{t}u-\Delta u=0$
4. Schrodringer $i \partial_{t}u+\Delta u=0$

Our goal is to develop some tools to study these prototypical 2nd order PDEs and to understand them quantitatively.
* [[Fundamental solutions]]
* [[Distribution theory]]
* Fourier transform
