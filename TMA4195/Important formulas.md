collapse: open
When $Y(\eta)$ is the inner solution and $y(x)$ is the outer solution:
$$\lim_{\eta  \to \infty}Y(\eta )= \lim_{x \to 0}y(x)$$
```

```ad-note
title: Uniform solution
collapse: open
Sum up the inner and outer solution and subtract the limit:
$$y^u= y(x)+Y\left(\frac{x}{\varepsilon }\right)-\lim_{x \to 0}y(x)$$
