As will be discussed in section \ref{sec:}, $T_{a}$ and $\eta$ will be used as the coupling from the electrophysiology to the mechanics. For now, let's denote that
$$
\begin{equation}
T_{a}=T_{a}\left( \mathbf{s},\lambda ,\frac{ \partial \lambda }{ \partial t }  \right),
\end{equation}
$$
where $\mathbf{s}$ are state variables defined in each cell (and in each point in the intracellular domain) and $\lambda$ is the stretch. Notice that $\mathbf{s}$ here differs from the deformed sheet axis $\mathbf{s}$.
