## Electrocardiogram
The first instance of an electrocardiogram (ECG) recording was in 1887 by August Waller. He demonstrated the method on his dog, Jimmy, by placing his paws in buckets of saline. The potential difference between the buckets was measured, and showed that it pulsated with Jimmy's heartbeats.

The method was improved by Willem Einthoven by attaching three electrodes to the left and right arm and the left leg. Denoting $\phi _\text{LA},\phi _\text{RA},\phi _\text{LL}$ as the potential in the left arm, the right arm and the left leg, Einthoven defined the potential differences as the leads
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf I&= \phi _\text{LA}-\phi _\text{RA},\\
\mathbf {II}&= \phi _\text{LL}-\phi _\text{RA},\\
\mathbf {III}&= \phi _\text{LL}-\phi _\text{LA}.
\end{aligned}$$

Already in 1909, the electrocardiogram was used to diagnose a case of arrhythmia ([src](https://www.gehealthcare.com/insights/article/exploring-the-history-of-the-ecg-and-its-influence-on-modern-medicine?srsltid=AfmBOorjhO7nA5o87_hMuq25m7pNZpkiOf_mgKGjnbxARDkLNrsR2s7k)).
