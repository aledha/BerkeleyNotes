There are three types of muscle cells; skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. 
Each muscle cell consists of several cylindrical structures called *myofibrils*, which consists of individual contractile units call *sarcomeres*. The sarcomeres, depicted in figure \ref{}, are composed of thin filaments made by the protein *actin* and thick filaments made by the protein *myosin*. There are three main stages in muscle activation: the action potential (which will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:}), the calcium ion release, and the contraction \cite{mathphys}.

The cell membrane has several ion channels that are voltage dependent. When the action potential reaches a cell, the calcium ion channels are opened, which results in a higher intracellular concentration of calcium. This results in a change of the structure of the myofibrils that allows a binding between the actin and myosin called a *crossbridge*. The crossbridge bends, which pulls the thin filament along the thick filament, resulting in a contraction. The bending of the crossbridge is called a *power stroke*.
