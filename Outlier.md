**Sure, here's a breakdown of how long you'll need to work to afford the down payment on the house:**

## Income and Expenses:

- **Hourly Rate:** $\$25/\text{hour}$
- **Weekly Hours:** $40 \text{hours}/\text{week}$
- **Weekly Earnings:** $\$25 \cdot 40 = \$1,000/\text{week}$
- **Monthly Earnings:** $\$1,000 \cdot 4.3 (\text{approximate number of weeks in a month}) = \$4,300/\text{month}$

- **Double Time Holidays (assuming 5 hrs paid at double time):** \$25 x 2 x 5 = \$250/\text{month}

**Total Monthly Income:** \$4300 + \$1612.50 +250 = \$6162.50

- **Health Insurance:** \$100/pay period x 2 pay periods/\text{month} = \$200/\text{month}
- **401K Contribution:** 5% of \$6162.50 = \$308.13/\text{month}
- **Taxes:** Approximately 15% of \$6162.50 = \$924.38/\text{month}

**Total Monthly Expenses:** \$200 +\$308.13 +\$400 +\$200 +\$400 +\$100 +\$924.38 = \$2532.51

**Disposable Income:** \$6162.50 - \$2532.51 = \$3629.99


## Home Affordability:

- **Down Payment on \$250,000 house (20%):** \$250,000 x .2 = \$50,000
- **Total Savings needed:** \$50,000

**Time to save for down payment:** \$50,000 / \$3629.99 per \text{month} â‰ˆ **13.78 \text{month}s** or about **1 year and 1 month.**
