## Income and Expenses:

- **Hourly Rate:** 
$$\$25/\text{hour}$$

- **Weekly Hours:** 
$$40 \text{ hours}/\text{week}$$
- **Weekly Earnings:** 
$$\$25 \cdot 40 =\$1,000/\text{week}$$
- **Monthly Earnings:** 
$$\$1,000 \cdot 4.3 (\text{approximate number of weeks in a month}) = \$4,300/\text{month}$$

- **Double Time Holidays:** 
$$\$25 \cdot 2 \cdot 8\text{ hours} \cdot 5 \text{ days}/\text{year} = \$2000/\text{year}=\$166.7/\text{month}$$

**Total Monthly Income:** 
$$\$4300 + \$166.7 = \$4466.7$$

- **Health Insurance:** 
$$\$100/\text{month}$$
- **401K Contribution:** 
$$5\% \text{ of } \$4466.7 = \$223.335/\text{month}$$
- **Approximate Taxes:**  
$$15\% \text{ of } \$4466.7 = \$670/\text{month}$$

**Total Monthly Expenses:** 
$$\$200 +\$223.335 +\$400 +\$200 +\$400 +\$100 +\$670+ \$100 = \$2293.335$$

**Disposable Income:** 
$$\$4466.7 - \$2293.335 = \$2173.365$$


## Home Affordability:

- **Down Payment on \$250,000 house (20%):** 
$$20\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = \$50,000$$
- **Total Savings needed:** 
$$\$50,000$$

**Time to save for down payment:** 
$$\frac{\$50,000}{\$2173.365  \text{ per month}} â‰ˆ 23.005 \text{ months}$$
or about **1 year and 11 month.**
