- Consider the slight variation on the 2D Model Problem, gotten by discretizing the slightly different PDE   
$$    -a \cdot  \frac{\text{d}^{2}v(x,y)}{\text{d}x^{2}} - b \cdot  \frac{\text{d}^{2}v(x,y)}{\text{d}y^{2}} = f(x,y)   $$
    where a and b are some positive constants. Briefly justify your answers to the following questions. (Hint: Use Matlab to confirm that your answers are correct for small examples.)
    - Using Kronecker product notation, write down the matrix; call it T(a,b).
$$\begin{align*}
-a \cdot \frac{v_{i-1,j}-2v_{i,j}+v_{i+1,j}}{h^{2}}-b \cdot \frac{v_{i,j-1}-2v_{i,j}+v_{i,j+1}}{h^{2}}&= F_{i,j}\\
-av_{i-1,j}-av_{i+1,j}+(2a+2b)v_{ij}-bv_{i,j-1}-bv_{i,j+1}&= h^{2}F_{i,j}
\end{align*}$$
Notice that





    - Write down explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of T(a,b), again using Kronecker product notation. Is T(a,b) symmetric and positive definite? What is its 2-norm condition number?
    - Does Jacobi's method converge for T(a,b)? What is rho(R_J), the spectral radius of the Jacobi iteration matrix R_J?
    
- Repeat the last question for the 3D problem gotten by discretizing   
    -a * d^2 v(x,y,z)/dx^2 - b * d^2 v(x,y,z)/dy^2 - c * d^2 v(x,y,z)/dz^2 = f(x,y,z)   
    where a, b and c are some positive constants.
