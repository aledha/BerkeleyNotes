- Consider the same slight variation on the 2D Model Problem, T(a,b), defined in last week's homework.
    
    - Is there an ordering of the equations and unknowns for which SOR(w) converges, for T(a,b), for some values of w? What ordering, and which values of w?




    - What value w_opt minimizes rho(R_SOR(w))? What is the value of rho(R_SOR(w_opt))?
