- Page 357, Question 6.5, Part 1: The expression for the eigenvectors should be: "z_ij, where z_ij = kron(y_j, x_i) whose ((l-1)\*m+k)th entry is x_i(k)\*y_j(l)" {using Matlab notation kron() for the Kronecker product}

- Page 358, Question 6.5, Part 3: "(km+l)th entry" should be "((k-1)*m+l)th" entry.
- Page 358, Question 6.5, Part 3: Equation (6.64) should be "(A kron B)(X kron Y) = (X kron Y)(Lambda_A kron Lambda_B)", although (6.64) is also mathematically correct. (Mathias Weiden)
